# Data_Analytics_Capstone_Project

## 📌 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to simulate a corporate-grade end-to-end data analytics workflow, demonstrating the ability to translate raw data into strategic business intelligence by:

✅ Data Preparation,Modeling & Exploratory Data Analysis (Python): Clean and transform the raw dataset for analysis.

✅ Data Analysis (SQL): Simulate business transactions, and run queries to extract insights on customer segments, loyalty, and purchase drivers.

✅ Visualization & Insights (Power BI): Build an interactive dashboard that highlights key patterns and trends, enabling stakeholders to make data-driven decisions.

✅ Report and Presentation: Write a clear project report summarizing your key findings and business recommendations. Prepare a presentation that visually communicates insights and actionable recommendations to stakeholders.

## Tools & Technologies

## Project Steps
1. Data Loading & Initial Inspection
Load dataset into Python environment using Pandas.

Perform initial inspection: check dimensions, data types, missing values, and basic statistics.

2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Handle missing values (imputation or removal).

Correct data types and formatting inconsistencies.

Remove duplicate entries.

Address outliers where appropriate.

3. SQL Integration & Analysis
Export cleaned data to PostgreSQL database.

Write and execute SQL queries for:

Aggregations and summaries

Joins and subqueries

Window functions for advanced analytics

Data validation and integrity checks

4. Power BI Dashboard Development
Connect Power BI to PostgreSQL database (direct query or import).

Design an interactive dashboard with:

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

Filters and slicers for user-driven exploration

Charts, graphs, and tailored to business questions

Drill-down capabilities for detailed analysis

6. Reporting & Presentation
Summarize findings in a comprehensive report (PDF/Word).

Create a professional PowerPoint presentation using Gamma for:

Project objectives and methodology

Key insights and data visualizations

Business implications and recommendations

Interactive elements or links to the dashboard

Dashboard
The Power BI dashboard provides an interactive interface for stakeholders to explore key metrics. Main features include:

Detailed Analysis Pages: Thematic tabs (e.g., Sales Performance, Customer Segmentation, Regional Analysis).

Interactivity: Cross-filtering, date range selectors, category slicers.

Data Refresh: Configured to refresh on schedule or on-demand.
