SELECT * FROM customer_tb

--Q1. What is the total revenue generated by male vs. female customers?

SELECT 
     gender,
	 SUM(purchase_amount) as revenue
FROM customer_tb
GROUP BY gender

--Q2. Which customers used a discount but still spent more than the average purchase amount?

SELECT 
     customer_id,
	 purchase_amount
FROM customer_tb
WHERE discount_applied = 'Yes' and purchase_amount >= (SELECT AVG(purchase_amount) from customer_tb) 

-- Q3. Which are the top 5 products with the highest average review rating?

SELECT 
     item_purchased,
	 ROUND(AVG(review_rating :: numeric),2) as avg_rating
FROM customer_tb
GROUP BY item_purchased
ORDER BY AVG(review_rating) DESC
LIMIT 5

--Q4. Compare the average Purchase Amounts between Standard and Express Shipping. 

SELECT 
     shipping_type,
	 ROUND(AVG(purchase_amount),2) 
FROM customer_tb
WHERE shipping_type in ('Express', 'Standard')
GROUP BY shipping_type

--Q5. Do subscribed customers spend more? Compare average spend and total revenue 
--between subscribers and non-subscribers.

SELECT 
     subscription_status,
	 COUNT(customer_id) as total_customers,
	 ROUND(AVG(purchase_amount),2) as avg_spend,
	 ROUND(SUM(purchase_amount),2) as total_revenue
FROM customer_tb
GROUP BY subscription_status
ORDER BY total_revenue, avg_spend DESC;
	 
--Q6. Which 5 products have the highest percentage of purchases with discounts applied?

SELECT 
     item_purchased,
	 ROUND(100 * SUM (CASE WHEN discount_applied = 'Yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*),2) as discount_rate
FROM customer_tb
GROUP BY item_purchased
ORDER BY discount_rate DESC
LIMIT 5;
	 
--Q7. Segment customers into New, Returning, and Loyal based on their total 
-- number of previous purchases, and show the count of each segment.

WITH customer_type as (
SELECT customer_id, previous_purchases,
CASE
    WHEN previous_purchases = 1 THEN 'New'
	WHEN previous_purchases BETWEEN 2 AND 10 THEN 'Returning'

--Q8. What are the top 3 most purchased products within each category? 

WITH item_counts as (
SELECT category , item_purchased,

ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY category ORDER BY COUNT (customer_id) DESC) as item_rank
FROM customer_tb
GROUP BY category, item_purchased
)
SELECT item_rank, category, item_purchased, total_orders
FROM item_counts
WHERE item_rank >= 3;

--Q9. Are customers who are repeat buyers (more than 5 previous purchases) also likely to subscribe?

SELECT subscription_status,
count(customer_id) as repeat_buyers
FROM customer_tb
WHERE previous_purchases > 5
GROUP BY subscription_status

--Q10. What is the revenue contribution of each age group? 

SELECT age_group,
